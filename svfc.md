SVFC Portal
A. Problem Statement:

In today's digital age, technology plays a crucial role in enhancing educational experiences. However, the current learning website of St. Vincent de Ferrer College faces several challenges in terms of usability and design. The platform lacks a user-friendly interface, making it difficult for students and faculty to navigate and access important resources efficiently. To ensure a more engaging and effective online learning experience, there is a pressing need for improvements in its interface design, navigation, and overall accessibility. A modern, intuitive, and responsive website would not only improve the usability but also contribute to a better educational environment for everyone at the college.

B. Project Description:

At St. Vincent de Ferrer College, we are committed to improving the online platform to better serve both students and professors. 

Our goal is to make the system easier to use, more efficient, and visually appealing. We’re focused on creating an interface that allows students to access learning materials quickly and easily, while enabling professors to manage their courses without hassle. By enhancing the user experience, we aim to build a system that is practical, user-friendly, and engaging for everyone.
